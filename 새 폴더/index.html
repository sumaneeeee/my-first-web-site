    <p><strong>web</strong> is a computer programming system created by Donald E. Knuth as the first implementation of what he called <u>"literate programming"</u>: the idea that one could create software as works of literature, by embedding source code inside descriptive text, rather than the reverse (as is common practice in most programming languages), in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers, rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px"><strong>web browsers</strong> receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
